# TurboThink

An experiment in integrating LLMs with UI elements.

Chat interfaces like ChatGPT require significant mental effort in formulating prompts and interpreting
the response. The hypothesis is that familiar UI elements like lists can reduce the friction of usage
for many use cases.

This is a standalone client-side web application and does not submit any data to a server except
the OpenAI API. The `gpt-4` model is used by default, but other OpenAI chat completion APIs should
work as well.

All data is stored in your browser's local storage.

## Get started (run locally)

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Some use cases

- Brainstorming
- Planning
- Structuring your ideas
- Task management / ToDo lists
- Notetaking
- Learning about the symbiosis of LLMs and UIs

## Features

- AI-based grouping, sorting and filtering lists 
- Get suggestions of criterias for grouping, sorting and filtering
- Generate lists based on other lists

## Future improvements

- More complex UI elements like tables and nested lists
- Error handling ðŸ˜€
- A more ergonomic UI
